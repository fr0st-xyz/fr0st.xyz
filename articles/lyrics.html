					<p data-song="April Mourning"><em>Fuck an idol, no one towers over me
					Hopefully, openly talking 'bout all of my emotions
					Ocean deep, sink into the bottom
					Opening up all my fucking problems
					Bitch, I promise I'll become forgotten, rotten
					Fucking spotted on the concrete
					Six times three
					If I was a key on the board, I'd probably be delete or escape
					Either way, you're pressing me, uh</em> 
					― <b>Ruby da Cherry</b></p>

					<p data-song="AM/PM"><em>I fall asleep, but I don't want to rise out of bed
					Escape to my dreams, I hope some of them wet
					The sun shinin' bright as I open my eyes
					And then close up the blinds, and wish that I was dead
					Some people wanna call me a pussy
					Some people wanna call me a bitch
					Some people wanna tell me that it ain't that bad
					"Lift up that chin"
					I wonder what they'd say after I slice my wrists
					Two slits, I'm gone in the endless abyss
					One way street, and I need a fucking lift
					If sleep is the cousin of death, I guess me and $lick countin' sheep 'til we outta breath, I mean, shit!
					Po-pourin' my emotions in a styrofoam cup
					Gulping it down 'till I don't give a fuck</em> 
					― <b>Yung Slumber</b></p>

					<p data-song="nothingleftnothingleft"><em>Suicide, suicide, let's all commit suicide
					End the human race just like the dinosaurs, I can't decide
					Would you rather drink the punch or do you wanna burn alive?
					No salvation, salutations, nothing left after we die
					(Feed me with your hate) Yeah, now that's a fucking start
					(Stab me in the skull) Make sure that the blade is sharp
					(Put my body in a ditch) Let the larva eat my heart
					(Infest my dead body) Let it rip my flesh apart</em>

					<em>War, power, sickness, death
					Famine, terror, toxic sex

					<p data-song="Whoa, I'm Woeful"><em>I'm the kind of motherfucker that don't go outside
					Pale skin boy, with the rope tied tight
					Gotta light up the blunt just to choke, 'bout time I feel something
					Climbing out of my funk, then I jump back in
					Punching a hole in the wall, let me in
					Bloody knuckles, unbuckle the belt, got a devilish grin
					Unfuckable, melt me away with my sins
					I'm in trouble, the bubbles should give you a hint
					Bitch, I'm sinking again in the bottomless pit
					Bitch, I'm rotten from all of the toxins I'm poppin'
					I'm poppin' from all of the toxins I'm copping</em> 
					― <b>Lord Of Loneliness</b></p>

					<p data-song="Kill Yourself (Part III)"><em>Always boasting my emotions on how I'm so fucking broken
					Think I'm joking when I'm talkin' about blowing my head open
					'Til the moment you walk in and find my body motionless
					Wrists slit, thoughts of $licky falling in an open pit, shit
					Always burn my bridges 'cause I'd rather fall in ditches
					If life's a game of inches, then my dick has been the biggest
					And my goal's to fuck the world until that motherfucker's twitchin'
					Lane switchin', same mission, to die and blame my addiction, bitch</em> 
					― <b>$lick $loth</b></p>

					<p data-song="Kill Yourself (Part III)"><em>They figure me a dead motherfucker
					But I'm just a motherfucker that wanna be dead
					Snow Leopard with the lead in his head, turnin' me into a sweater
					Bitches use me as their fucking bedspread
					I be the silhouette of a sunset
					Smoke a cigarette while I compress my depression
					Stare into the violet fluorescent lights, makes me violent
					I'm tryna get the highest I can get before I overdose and die
					My ribs are nothing but an empty cage, black hole in my chest
					Big bang, Yung Plague on the tip of a wave
					In my head, I feel like I'm a guest, so I'ma throw it all away
					Because when I am dead, I will be nothing decomposin' in a grave
					I'm matter, but I don't matter
					I can feel my skull shatter from the dull chatter
					Brain splattered on the wall
					Grey stains won't dissolve, gonna have to paint it all</em> 
					― <b>Ruby da Cherry</b></p>

					<p data-song="Shattered Amethyst"><em>Do you feel my essence? Depressing presence
					My main goal in death is to blow up heaven
					Don't get the message, can't teach the lesson
					Just a feeling that you get when you hang with peasants</em>

					<p data-song="Fold"><em>Pay-pay me, pay me, pay me
					Bitch, I'm broke I need some fuckin' tape
					Y'all think y'all are wavy, but I be the motherfuckin' wave
					Everything is gravy, place me safely in my fuckin' grave
					I'm a shady motherfucker steady sippin' lemonade</em>

					<p data-song="#1 Stunna"><em>Everyday I hold my breath, tryna meet death  
					No check, no balance, and no debt 
					No money, no cars but I'm on flex</em> 
					― <b>Yung Christ</b></p>

					<p data-song="Lo-Fi (Kill 'Em All)"><em>Loneliness is my finesse
					Satan in the flesh
					Me and God didn't mesh
					Unlimited freshness
					Grinnin' for death
					Money, I need less
					(Money, I need less)
					Fuck a fuckin' check
					Check back with the TEC
					MAC-10 make you wet
					Fuck giving it thought, when I could just get head
					Layin' in bed thinking 'bout how my life is like my bank account
					Bitch, it's empty and spent</em> 
					― <b>Norman Atomic</b></p>

					<p data-song="Prince Tulip"><em>Don't give a fuck about yesterday, or give a fuck about today
					And tomorrow gonna be the same fucking way</em> 
					― <b>Anthony Mars</b></p>

					<p data-song="Sleepy Hollow (Slopped & Chewed)"><em>Slightly overrated, mean I'm over being rated by cops, critics
					Cynical assholes that ain't creative
					My styles jagged but my attitude seems jaded
					Like a diamond thats shine has really faded
					From sitting on some chick's finger too long
					I'm in the basement huffing paintings of animals in cages, uh
					You ready? I've been waitin'
					Oddy Nuff will leave your body shakin', probably achin'
					Man, fuck a vacation
					My narration of your duration ends in mutation with starvation and salvation</em> 
					― <b>Ruby da Cherry</b></p>

					<p data-song="$Hrimp Poboy"><em>Sleepin' through the weekend, suicidal seasons

					<p data-song="$Hrimp Poboy"><em>I wanna say screw it but I know improvement will prove it
					Fuck it</em> 
					― <b>Oddy Nuff da $now Leopard</b></p>

					<p data-song="Diemonds"><em>What I hate most in this life is a long night
					Four walls and no calls, and no lights
					But the moonlight creepin' through the blinds
					Ceiling fan on high spinnin'
					I'm beginning to believe that tonight is the night
					Dead by dawn
					I'll shred my palms to the end of my arm
					I'm spread and gone, embalmed
					Put me in the dirt where I belong
					Existence is overrated anyway
					Fifty years later, they won't remember you're dead
					Six billion people living as civilians, and I hated them all
					I should have been a vermillion reptilian living in a swamp
					(At least I'd have scales to protect me from the pain)</em> 
					― <b>Ruby Da Cherry</b></p>

					<p data-song="New Chains, Same Shackles"><em>Another day waitin' for death
					Every day that I waste on my list of regrets, so I tell myself
					"It's okay, day after next, we'll make all these arrangements to change, you can better yourself" (Uh-oh)
					I know I'm wasting my breath as I inhale
					I know I'm escaping my death as I inhale
					I can't recall why I'm suffocating
					My lungs are failin'</em> 
					― <b>Raindrop Walka</b></p>

					<p data-song="5 Grand At 8 To 1"><em>Ain't nobody fuckin' with me like they used to
					Open seat in the coupe so I scooped you
					I get caught up in my thoughts and I can't think right
					Caught up in a nightmare so I don't sleep right
					I just want them to treat me like they used to
					I just want something real that I'm used to
					I just want them to treat me like—uh, ayy
					I just want something real that I'm—uh, yeah</em> 
					― <b>Maire de Gras Ville</b></p>

					<p data-song="I Miss My Dead Friends"><em>Yeah, it sucks
					When you realize life is fast and I'm a fuckin' cashless organism
					Tryna thrive inside a habitat that's plastic</em> 
					― <b>Ruby Da Cherry</b></p>

					<p data-song="I Ended Up Driving The Camaro Off The Causeway Bridge"><em>I been disrespected my whole life
					What makes you think I give a fuck what you think?
					I pay no mind, I keep thinking about the afterlife
					After life is over I'll be casting dice with Satan
					Just to pass the time slower
					Closer to the lower polar lasting fire
					Suicide ain't sacrifice, it's the asking price in the black void
					No flashing lights, I'm fucking satisfied with gnats and flies
					Snacking on my calves and thighs
					Detach my eyes, and hang 'em by the casket pile</em> 
					― <b>Yung Mutt</b></p>

					<p data-song="Handzum $uicide"><em>I'm a different kind of breed, the one that don't even breathe
					The one you ain't gotta feed, just rob and take what I need
					Fucking product of the $uicide
					Fucking spawn of Satan
					Cuttin' on my wrist, while these women fornicating
					I'm debating to take my life, forsaken by sacrifice (Sacrficice)
					Mistaken for something nice (Nice)</em> 
					― <b>$lick $loth</b></p>

					<p data-song="Leave Me Alone"><em>Fuck everyobody
					Galaxies fall when I'm comin' down, nobody comes around
					I can't do no right
					Twenty stories high, holdin' up the sky
					They wanna say goodbye, I just want better times
					But I done got replaced
					I'm on my own and I'm tired
					Dreams fall like nothing, dead slow, dead
					Go on without plunging
					I'm so numb, I'm so numb, have you ever been this low?
					(Fuck no)</em> 
					― <b>LIL HALF CUT</b></p>

					<p data-song="Leave Me Alone"><em>I have realized I wanna rewind my whole life, it seems fine
					I have realized that I am alone
					$now Leopard wants to freeze and die
					Winter breath, wishin' for death in the snow
					Winter breath, wishin' for death in the snow
					I am zero, anti-hero
					Winter death, wishin' for breath— but I choke
					Whisperin' help but no one is listening
					Goddammit, my piss, it stings
					I'm planning on repeating history
					Repeat it blissfully, revealing misery</em> 
					― <b>LIL LONELY</b></p>

					<p data-song="Bags"><em>Fuck your God, I'll burn him on the cross
					Burnin' Buddha 'til my eyes are crossed</em>

					Natural Born Killers, get relief from my aggression
					Symbol of oppression, triple six flexin'
					Fuckboys love my seconds, smoking dope while I'm textin'
					Sounds so simple, right? Artesian on some ice
					Both wrists sliced, killing myself every night
					Motherfuckers wanna adopt the dark, but I was born in it</em> 
					― <b>$crim</b></p>

					<p data-song="Aphrodite (The Aquatic Ape Theory)"><em>Death in the night, hidin' from the light
					Everything changes when you make it out alive
					Middle of the night, hopin' that I die
					Middle of the night, always fucking high
					Got a life I'm tryna shake
					Get the fuck away
					Die slow for me, baby
					Let's get the fuck away
					Die slow, let's get the fuck away</em> 
					― <b>$crim & Ruby da Cherry</b></p>

					<p data-song="Aphrodite (The Aquatic Ape Theory)"><em>I'm hopin' that someone will come and slit my throat
					And then I can finally overdose
					Shawty lookin' like she needs some rest
					So in the grave, she goes
					I'm right beside her, she tryna get what's in my chest
					Hollow ribs, she doesn't know that I'm a ghost
					Hauntin' the air with my sweet decay
					For death, I do not delay
					Yeah, that's why my skin is grey</em> 
					― <b>Ruby da Cherry</b></p>

					I wanna be left alone, gonna see how long I'll hold
					Until I end up fighting off temptations
					Of self-annihilation (Self-annihilation)
					I'm holdin' myself hostage by all of this emotional blockage
					I can't fuckin' stop it now, it's all coming out (It's all coming out!)
					A verbal kind of vomit, I wish I could gut it out (Gut it out!)
					Take away my stomach, fuckin' rip it all apart (Apart)
					A hollow cage of calcium that used to hold my heart
					I know I'm meant to be alone
					I can feel it in my bones (Holding myself hostage by all of this emotional blockage)
					And in my soul (Holding myself hostage by all of this emotional blockage)</em> 
					― <b>Lord Of Loneliness</b></p>

					<p data-song="Antarctica"><em>I am the Lord of Loneliness
					I'll hold my breath, just spoke with Death
					He said he hopes for the best
					Told him I'm ropin' my neck
					Then I woke up chokin' from the hole in my chest
					Somehow I manage to function and hope
					Every day got a lump in my throat
					That's them pills swallowed whole
					Smoke a blunt and then fuck all these hoes
					End up humpin' they throat
					Get the fuck away from me, I hate all of you, faithfully
					This world was never made for me
					Thankfully, I'm trained to see past all the lies, the ranks, the scenes

					Fuck God, never gave me a response, so I listen to the devil instead
					Yeah, bitch, steady wishing I was dead
					(Six-six) Six ways to kill me
